# GSNetworks_TwitterData

Project Introduction

Our project will explore collecting data sets from the popular social network, Twitter (X), showing various accounts and the users they choose to follow. This data set is similar to the Star Wars character interactions example shown in class. We will identify communities from the accounts and their connections with each other.

Dataset Insight

Free dataset chosen: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/goyaladi/twitter-dataset/data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hwassner/TwitterFriends/data)
dataset will be used for identifying full Twitter user profile data, including who they follow

Data Mining & Cleaning Procedures

In the context of identifying influential users, centrality measures such as degree centrality, betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality can be used to find accounts that have a significant impact on the network.

Data preprocessing is extremely important to ensure the integrity of the network analysis. Removing duplicate tweets, handling retweets, filtering out non-English tweets and extracting relevant features from users are all good procedures to consider when cleaning the data.

Expected Outcome

We will be focusing on collecting and analyzing Twitter data to identify communities and connections among users.
