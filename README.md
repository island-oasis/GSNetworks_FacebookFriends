# GSNetworks_TwitterData
Our project will explore collecting data sets from the popular social network, Twitter (X), showing various accounts and the users they choose to follow. This data set is similar to the Star Wars character interactions example shown in class. We will identify communities from the accounts and their connections with each other.
